<p>The first version of this post was written in February of 2015. It&#39;s finally going
to go up on December 31st. I&#39;ve been busy and Octopress 3.x is still not entirely
kink free (in fact, I had to run <code>bundle exec octopress new post &quot;Starting From Scratch With Octopress 3.0&quot;</code>, because for some reason <code>octopress new post ...</code> alone causes a <code>LoadError</code> on
<code>octopress-genesis-theme</code>) and still doesn&#39;t work with Jekyll 3.x.</p>

<p>Long ago I tried starting a blog on GitHub with Octopress 2.x, but I quickly got
frustrated with it because it involved basically forking Brandon Mathis&#39;s blog and
tweaking it and hoping nothing upstream conflicted with any changes you made, which
it always did. Or at least for me, but I could&#39;ve been doing everything wrong. So
I&#39;m just blowing that version of the blog away and starting over now that Octopress
is a set of Ruby gems instead.</p>

<p>Now that I&#39;ve figured out how to get Octopress 3.x working I&#39;m going to try to
seriously get this blog going. Out of the gate I&#39;m using the default <a href="https://github.com/octopress/genesis-theme">Genesis theme</a>, because <a href="https://github.com/octopress/ink">Ink</a>
isn&#39;t documented well enough yet for other themes to exist or for me
to take a stab at it myself (at least given that I don&#39;t have a lot of time to
spend on it). I&#39;m also planning to add Disqus comments in the not too distant future,
once I&#39;m happy with the things are working. I&#39;ll also slowly remove all the default
boilerplate Jekyll stuff and personalize it. But I want to get this officially
started before the end of 2015.</p>

<p>Coming soon: a post about who I am and what this blog will be about.</p>
