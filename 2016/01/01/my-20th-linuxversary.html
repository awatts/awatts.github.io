With some Christmas ‘95 money I bought a book at MediaPlay that came with Slackware 2.3 (released 1995-05-10) on CD. The Wikipedia entry for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slackware">Slackware</a> claims 3.0 was the first version to come on CD, but my bookshelf disagrees, and the book the CD came with was written by Patrick Volkerding himself.</p><p>At the time I had my first computer of my own, which had a Cyrix Cx486DX2-80, 8MB RAM, and a decent sized hard drive for the time; I’m thinking it was either 500MB or maybe even 1GB. It came with DOS 6.22 and Windows 3.11 For Workgroups. I didn’t have the Microsoft install media (and I wouldn’t be surprised if the store I bought it from didn’t have a valid license), so I feared formatting and used UMSDOS and Loadlin to install and boot Linux on top of DOS and the FAT filesystem.</p><p>With my next computer I moved on to SuSE, which I stuck with through the 6.x and 7.x versions. I took a couple year detour through BeOS, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD before landing on Debian around 2004 with Woody (3.0). Eventually I got sick of how bad Linux was on laptops (I’ve gathered it’s improved immensely) and bought a PowerBook G4 with MacOS X 10.3 (Unix on a laptop that works!) and have had a couple more Mac desktops and laptops over the years (typing this on a 2012 MacBook Pro 15”), but I’ve kept some sort of Debian box at work and/or home constantly.</p></div><div id="post-nav"> <a class="prev" href="/administrative/2015/12/31/starting-from-scratch-with-octopress-3-0.html">« Starting From Scratch With Octopress 3.0</a></div><div class="post-comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script>var disqus_shortname="awatts",disqus_url="https://awatts.us/2016/01/01/my-20th-linuxversary.html",disqus_identifier="https://awatts.us/2016/01/01/my-20th-linuxversary.html",disqus_title="My 20th Linuxversary";!function(){var t=document.createElement("script");t.async=!0,t.type="text/javascript",t.src="//awatts.disqus.com/embed.js",(document.getElementsByTagName("HEAD")[0]||document.getElementsByTagName("BODY")[0]).appendChild(t)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript" rel="nofollow">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript></div></article><footer class="footer"><div class="pure-menu pure-menu-horizontal"><h2 class="footer-heading">Andrew Watts's Blog</h2><ul><li class="pure-menu-item"><a href="mailto:andrew.l.watts@gmail.com">andrew.l.watts@gmail.com</a></li><li class="pure-menu-item"> <a href="https://github.com/awatts"><span class="icon icon--github"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill="#828282" d="M7.999,0.431c-4.285,0-7.76,3.474-7.76,7.761 c0,3.428,2.223,6.337,5.307,7.363c0.388,0.071,0.53-0.168,0.53-0.374c0-0.184-0.007-0.672-0.01-1.32 c-2.159,0.469-2.614-1.04-2.614-1.04c-0.353-0.896-0.862-1.135-0.862-1.135c-0.705-0.481,0.053-0.472,0.053-0.472 c0.779,0.055,1.189,0.8,1.189,0.8c0.692,1.186,1.816,0.843,2.258,0.645c0.071-0.502,0.271-0.843,0.493-1.037 C4.86,11.425,3.049,10.76,3.049,7.786c0-0.847,0.302-1.54,0.799-2.082C3.768,5.507,3.501,4.718,3.924,3.65 c0,0,0.652-0.209,2.134,0.796C6.677,4.273,7.34,4.187,8,4.184c0.659,0.003,1.323,0.089,1.943,0.261 c1.482-1.004,2.132-0.796,2.132-0.796c0.423,1.068,0.157,1.857,0.077,2.054c0.497,0.542,0.798,1.235,0.798,2.082 c0,2.981-1.814,3.637-3.543,3.829c0.279,0.24,0.527,0.713,0.527,1.437c0,1.037-0.01,1.874-0.01,2.129 c0,0.208,0.14,0.449,0.534,0.373c3.081-1.028,5.302-3.935,5.302-7.362C15.76,3.906,12.285,0.431,7.999,0.431z"/></svg> </span><span class="username">awatts</span></a></li><li class="pure-menu-item"> <a href="https://twitter.com/awatts_"><span class="icon icon--twitter"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill="#828282" d="M15.969,3.058c-0.586,0.26-1.217,0.436-1.878,0.515c0.675-0.405,1.194-1.045,1.438-1.809c-0.632,0.375-1.332,0.647-2.076,0.793c-0.596-0.636-1.446-1.033-2.387-1.033c-1.806,0-3.27,1.464-3.27,3.27 c0,0.256,0.029,0.506,0.085,0.745C5.163,5.404,2.753,4.102,1.14,2.124C0.859,2.607,0.698,3.168,0.698,3.767 c0,1.134,0.577,2.135,1.455,2.722C1.616,6.472,1.112,6.325,0.671,6.08c0,0.014,0,0.027,0,0.041c0,1.584,1.127,2.906,2.623,3.206 C3.02,9.402,2.731,9.442,2.433,9.442c-0.211,0-0.416-0.021-0.615-0.059c0.416,1.299,1.624,2.245,3.055,2.271 c-1.119,0.877-2.529,1.4-4.061,1.4c-0.264,0-0.524-0.015-0.78-0.046c1.447,0.928,3.166,1.469,5.013,1.469 c6.015,0,9.304-4.983,9.304-9.304c0-0.142-0.003-0.283-0.009-0.423C14.976,4.29,15.531,3.714,15.969,3.058z"/></svg> </span><span class="username">awatts_</span></a></li></ul></div></footer></div></div><script>!function(t,e,r){var n,s=t.getElementsByTagName(e)[0],i=/^http:/.test(t.location)?"http":"https";t.getElementById(r)||(n=t.createElement(e),n.id=r,n.src=i+"://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(n,s))}(document,"script","twitter-wjs")</script><script>!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-35871295-1","auto"),ga("send","pageview")</script></body></html>
