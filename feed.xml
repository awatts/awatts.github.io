        <title>My 20th Linuxversary</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t remember the exact date that I started using Linux, but it&amp;#39;s been 20 years
sometime in early January. With some Christmas &amp;#39;95 money I bought a book at MediaPlay
that came with Slackware 2.3 (released 1995-05-10) on CD. The Wikipedia entry for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slackware&quot;&gt;Slackware&lt;/a&gt; claims 3.0 was the first version
to come on CD, but my bookshelf disagrees, and the book the CD came with was written
by Patrick Volkerding himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time I had my first computer of my own, which had a Cyrix Cx486DX2-80, 8MB RAM,
and a decent sized hard drive for the time; I&amp;#39;m thinking it was either 500MB or maybe
even 1GB. It came with DOS 6.22 and Windows 3.11 For Workgroups. I didn&amp;#39;t have the
Microsoft install media (and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if the store I bought it from
didn&amp;#39;t have a valid license), so I feared formatting and used UMSDOS and Loadlin
to install and boot Linux on top of DOS and the FAT filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my next computer I moved on to SuSE, which I stuck with through the 6.x and 7.x
versions. I took a couple year detour through BeOS, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD before
landing on Debian around 2004 with Woody (3.0). Eventually I got sick of how bad
Linux was on laptops (I&amp;#39;ve gathered it&amp;#39;s improved immensely) and bought a PowerBook
G4 with MacOS X 10.3 (Unix on a laptop that works!) and have had a couple more Mac
desktops and laptops over the years (typing this on a 2012 MacBook Pro 15&amp;quot;), but
I&amp;#39;ve kept some sort of Debian box at work and/or home constantly.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Starting From Scratch With Octopress 3.0</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The first version of this post was written in February of 2015. It&amp;#39;s finally going
to go up on December 31st. I&amp;#39;ve been busy and Octopress 3.x is still not entirely
kink free (in fact, I had to run &lt;code&gt;bundle exec octopress new post &amp;quot;Starting From Scratch With Octopress 3.0&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, because for some reason &lt;code&gt;octopress new post ...&lt;/code&gt; alone causes a &lt;code&gt;LoadError&lt;/code&gt; on
&lt;code&gt;octopress-genesis-theme&lt;/code&gt;) and still doesn&amp;#39;t work with Jekyll 3.x.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long ago I tried starting a blog on GitHub with Octopress 2.x, but I quickly got
frustrated with it because it involved basically forking Brandon Mathis&amp;#39;s blog and
tweaking it and hoping nothing upstream conflicted with any changes you made, which
it always did. Or at least for me, but I could&amp;#39;ve been doing everything wrong. So
I&amp;#39;m just blowing that version of the blog away and starting over now that Octopress
is a set of Ruby gems instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;#39;ve figured out how to get Octopress 3.x working I&amp;#39;m going to try to
seriously get this blog going. Out of the gate I&amp;#39;m using the default &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/octopress/genesis-theme&quot;&gt;Genesis theme&lt;/a&gt;, because &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/octopress/ink&quot;&gt;Ink&lt;/a&gt;
isn&amp;#39;t documented well enough yet for other themes to exist or for me
to take a stab at it myself (at least given that I don&amp;#39;t have a lot of time to
spend on it). I&amp;#39;m also planning to add Disqus comments in the not too distant future,
once I&amp;#39;m happy with the things are working. I&amp;#39;ll also slowly remove all the default
boilerplate Jekyll stuff and personalize it. But I want to get this officially
started before the end of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming soon: a post about who I am and what this blog will be about.&lt;/p&gt;
